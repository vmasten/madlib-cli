# Project Name
Mad Libs CLI

**Author**: Vince Masten
**Version**: 1.0.1

## Overview
A Python module for creating Mad Libs from well-formed plaintext input. Parses the input, finds which parts of speech need to be changed by traversing the file for words enclosed in {}, asks the user to provide these parts of speech, and recombines the result into an inevitably silly story.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repo from github.com/vmasten
1. Run madlib.py with your favorite Python interpreter
1. Get ready to come up with some parts of speech!

## Architecture
Uses Python 3.6.7, pipenv, and pytest
